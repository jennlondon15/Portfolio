## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Please make sure you have a modern text editor and a web browser.

I suggest these applications ðŸ¤˜

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/)

### Installing

```git
git clone git@github.com:jennlondon15/Train-Scheduler.git
```

> Note: There is a Firebase API Key included in this source code. _Not to be used for production_

Reference [Firebase API documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs) for further information.

You can then simply open the `index.html` file in your browser and input the required information to track the next train arrival.
