                <p>
                  Born and raised in Arizona, I moved to Colorado at 18,
                  relocating to Denver a year later. Working for the dental
                  industry, coordinating dental insurance for a local office for
                  two years. I decided that is not what I wanted to do with the
                  rest of my life, so I looked into programs to give me valuable
                  and applicable skills that I could use in the work force. I've
                  always been a problem solver and have always enjoyed that
                  aspect of the coding world. Now, working full time, I am an
                  aspiring Web Developer.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Though I am dedicated to my school and furthing myself and my
                  career I am not just a coder. I am a proud mother of
                  two...cats. Mia (shamelessly named after Mia Thermopolis from
                  'The Princess Diaries') and Berlioz (AKA Little B...because
                  sometimes he is a little b). I am also a huge book nerd and
                  musical geek. When I have the time, I've been known to hole
                  myself up and read as many as 8 books a week. I know...maybe a
                  little much, but it's what I do. I studied musical theatre in
                  school. That has been my main passion for as long as I can
                  remember, and that continues to be true even today.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Although I love nerding out on my books or musicals, I also am
                  very into athletics. Don't hate me Denver, but I am loyal
                  DiamondBacks fan...not the Rockies. As much of a spectator I
                  am I also enjoy playing the sport with friends. I am a person
                  of very vast hobbies and intrests and look forward to what my
                  future holds.
